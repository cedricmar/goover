# GOOVER

HTTP hoover - make a static website of anything

In other words it is a website vacuum :)

It was designed after experimenting with a static site generator, I figured why not make your website with any framework or CMS and just syphon the thing to make it static.

There is my attempt at making static websites with anything !

### Usage:

goover \<url> \<folder>

**url** is a website url to vacuum

**folder** is the path where you want to save on your computer
